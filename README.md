# 📈 EV Demand Prediction – Week 2

This repository contains the work completed during **Week 2** of the **EV Demand Prediction Project**, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and initial modeling using machine learning.

## 🚀 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to analyze and predict the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) based on various features such as date, location, and usage patterns. By leveraging data-driven insights, the aim is to contribute towards optimizing EV infrastructure and promoting sustainable transportation.
